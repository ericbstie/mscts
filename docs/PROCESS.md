# Process

How mscts gets built. The main session acts as **tech lead** and delegates
the implementation work to **worker** subagents. Every worker ends with a
retrospective. The tech lead turns those retrospectives into changes to
this process, the skills, the plan or the goals. The process is itself a
product that we keep optimising.

This file is owned by the tech lead. It changes only through the
[changelog](#process-changelog) at the bottom.

## Roles

**Tech lead (the main session).**
- Owns the queue (`docs/PROGRESS.md`), `docs/PLAN.md`, the ADRs, this
  file, and the skills.
- Writes briefs, chooses the model, and spawns workers.
- Reviews and integrates the workers' commits into `main`, then pushes.
- Reads every retrospective and decides what to change.
- Sends work to refactoring or auditing when retrospectives or reviews
  show drift.
- Writes product code only for trivial integration fixes. Anything more
  goes in a brief.

**Worker (a subagent).** Executes exactly one brief, following the
`red-green` skill, in an isolated git worktree. It commits each increment
green, does not push, and ends with the [report](#worker-report).

## Choosing the model

| Model | Use for |
| --- | --- |
| `opus` (Opus 5.5) | Heavy or critical-to-get-right work: interfaces; process lifecycle and concurrency (runner, Connection, Bot); the Comparison engine; Masks and canonicalization; audits; refactors across modules; anything where a subtle mistake would silently corrupt Verdicts or Measurements. |
| `sonnet` (Sonnet 5) | Well-specified, mechanical work: wire types from sample tables, packet schemas from wiki tables, Adapter config translation from an explicit field list, docs. |

When unsure, use `opus`. A wrong Verdict costs more than a slower worker.

## Cycle

1. **Plan a batch.** Choose 1–3 briefs from Next that touch disjoint
   modules, so they can run in parallel without conflicts.
2. **Brief and spawn** each one in the background with worktree
   isolation, using the [template](#brief-template).
3. **Integrate** each branch as it finishes:
   - Review the diff against the PLAN interfaces. Check that the tests
     would fail without the code, that no lint, type or security rule was
     loosened, and that the vocabulary matches `CONTEXT.md`.
   - Rebase onto `main` with every commit re-checked:
     `git rebase main -x "mise run check"`.
   - Fast-forward `main` and push.
4. **Retrospective intake.** Log every item in the
   [retrospective log](#retrospective-log) and decide one of:
   - **adopt**: change the skill, PLAN, PROCESS or goal now, in a
     `docs:` or `tooling:` commit;
   - **defer**: add it to Next;
   - **reject**: record why.
5. **Update `docs/PROGRESS.md`** (Now, Next, Log) and push.
6. **Audit or refactor** after about every third batch, and sooner if
   retrospectives repeat a complaint or a review finds drift. An
   audit is an `opus` brief that reads a key feature end to end against
   PLAN, ADRs and the Reference, and reports findings before changing
   anything.

## Brief template

```
You are a worker on mscts (repo at your cwd, a git worktree of main).
Read CLAUDE.md, docs/PROCESS.md (Worker contract + Worker report), and the
red-green and protocol-research skills before starting.

Goal: <one sentence, in CONTEXT.md vocabulary>
Increments (in order, one commit each): <numbered list, each a single failing test>
Interfaces: <PLAN.md section(s) to implement exactly; allowed deviations>
Out of scope: <what not to touch>
Done when: <observable condition, e.g. `mise run check` green + named tests exist>
Context: <facts, file paths, gotchas the tech lead already knows>
```

## Worker contract

- **Setup** in your worktree: `mise trust --yes && mise run sync`. Tools
  are on PATH through the mise shims. Run anything that needs Java 25
  through `mise run …` or `mise exec -- …`.
- Follow the `red-green` skill. One increment per commit, and every
  commit passes `mise run check`.
- Do **not** push, merge, or edit `docs/PROGRESS.md` or `docs/PROCESS.md`.
  The tech lead owns them.
- **Do** edit `CONTEXT.md` or the interface section of `docs/PLAN.md` in
  the same commit when your increment changes vocabulary or an interface,
  and list it under "Interface changes" in your report.
- Tests that start servers must pick a free ephemeral port, never 25565,
  and must clean up their processes, even on failure. Other workers may
  run servers at the same time.
- Downloads go to the git-ignored cache (`.cache/mscts/`) and are
  hash-verified wherever the source publishes a hash.
- Stay inside the brief. If you are blocked, or the brief is wrong, stop
  and say so in the report rather than widening scope.

## Worker report

End your final message with exactly these sections:

```
## Done
<commit hash + subject, one per line>

## Not done / blocked
<what and why, or "nothing">

## Interface changes
<changes to PLAN.md interfaces or CONTEXT.md terms, or "none">

## Retrospective
For EVERY issue you stumbled on that was not as expected (tooling, docs,
brief, protocol facts, tests, environment), give:
- Expected: …
- Actual: …
- Cost: <time / iterations lost>
- Proposal: <concrete change to the process, a skill, the plan or a goal, or "none">
Finish with the single change that would most have sped you up.
```

## Retrospective log

Newest first. Every retrospective item gets a row.
